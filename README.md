# modals-
Modals are a popular UI element used in web design to display content in a popup window that overlays the current page. Modals are typically used to show additional information or to prompt the user for input. Modals can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to create the basic structure of the modal, including the content that will be displayed. CSS is used to style the modal, including its size, position, and appearance. JavaScript is used to control the behavior of the modal, including when it appears and disappears, and how it interacts with the rest of the page. Modals can be triggered by user actions such as clicking a button or link, or they can be set to appear automatically after a certain amount of time. Modals are a useful tool for creating engaging and interactive user experiences on a website.
